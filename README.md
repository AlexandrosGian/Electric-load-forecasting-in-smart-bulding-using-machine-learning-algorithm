# Electric-load-forecasting-in-smart-bulding-using-machine-learning-algorithm
In the context of my thesis, I developed a Python algorithm which forecasts the electrical load of four buildings every 15 minutes and 1 hour.

We develop this code using Python programming language and LSTM algorithm. 

# Keys of this stydy
1. LSTM networks
2. Run this code in three comptuter systems ( A local computer with I5 4210u  processor , CPU processor of Google Colab , GPU of Google Colab )
